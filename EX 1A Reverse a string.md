# EX 1A Reverse a String
## DATE:09-07-2025
## AIM:
To write a program to create a recursive function to reverse a string.

## Algorithm
1. Define a Function: Create a function named rev that takes one input, which is expected to be a string.
2. Reverse the String: Inside the rev function, use string slicing [::-1] to create a reversed copy of the input string.
3. Return the Reversed String: The rev function returns the newly created reversed string.
4. Get User Input: The program prompts the user to enter some text using the input() function and stores this input string in a variable named string.
5. Call the Function and Print
## Program:
```

string = input()
result = rev(string)
print(resuLt)
```

## Result:
The program successfully reverses the input string using recursion. When the user provides an input string, the output displays the reversed version of the string
